This is a little link shortner.
===============================

URLs are shortened to a random slug, there is no hashing involved.

Shortened URLs are stored in a local sqlite. 
This is probably not the best idea, but it's what I've got for now.

You need a username/password, but really just a password, which is stored in the secret.env file.
